    <p>To estimate the number of riders and bike time of CitiBike users, two linear regression models were constructed. The data used for this project were the CitiBike System Data (2016) and information from OpenWeatherMap, including temperature, wind speed, and weather conditions. To limit the data to a more manageable size, the second week of each month was selected in lieu of each day, which would have resulted to more than 36 million data points..</p>
<p>
  After the data was selected, it was reclassified and/or categorized using R. The final binary variables were gender, user types, weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rain, fog, snow, and thunder), hours of the day (5am-11am, 11am-5pm, 5pm-11pm, 11pm-5am), and weekday/weekend. That of continuous variables were the number of riders, age, temperature, and wind. Outliners and NAs for gender and user types were omitted from the analysis. The final number of observation was 2,813,744. The regression models were then made with 14 variables.
