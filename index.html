  CitiBike continues to grow as popular alternative mode of transport to explore New York City. With over 12,000 bikes spread over 750 stations in 60 neighborhoods, it is no wonder they’ve logged a total ridership of over 16 million riders in 2017. New riders are able to subscribe to an annual membership, like 89% of it’s current riders, or sign up for a single ride or day pass.

    Currently, the majority of CitiBike riders consist of male riders accounting for 67% of the annual ridership. While female riders still enjoy a continuous yearly increase in ridership share, they are still less than half of the male riders.

      <p>  While examining the data further, we’ve decided to further explore ridership by month. Not surprisingly, there are cyclical trends that correlate to the changing of the seasons as weather. Ridership is strong in the warmer months and dramatically fewer during the colder months. However, upon further exploration we’ve uncovered that the ridership growth within each respective month seem to have differing trends. Our project aims to visually present to what extent is CitiBike’s ridership affected by different types of variables such as gender and weather.
